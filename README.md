3. The Lambda functions handle logic such as adding items to the cart or fetching product data.
4. All user and product data is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB**.
5. Authentication is managed via **Amazon Cognito**, which secures user access.
6. To recieve the discount code users register with their mail and get the discount code using **Amazon SNS**. (optional)
